This is my first Swift/SwiftUI app.

It's an iOS app where you can see movies and tv shows trending in current week. Data is from the movie database (https://www.themoviedb.org) or more specifically it's API (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

Using Swift and SwiftUI.

To run this you simply open the the **Trending.xcodeproj** file in Xcode (I used version 13.3.1) and run in a simulator.

Thank you Zamzam for being helpful and patience.
